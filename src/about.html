      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Noah, a 21-year-old from Ellicott City, Maryland. Currently, I'm in my senior year at the
        University of Maryland, College Park, pursuing a Bachlor's Degrees, with a major in Computer Science and minor
        in Mathematics with a focus on Machine Learning. I am completing my internship at Capital One at the beginning
      of August, and starting a new full-time Software Development Engineer Internship as Amazon at the end of August!</p>

      <p>Over the course of my academic journey, I've dived deep into both the theoretical and applied aspects of
        computer science. This exploration has given me comprehensive insights into algorithmic theory, various machine
        learning techniques, model development, and training. Moreover, I've acquired hands-on experience with diverse
        programming paradigms, including object-oriented and functional approaches, as well as a deeper understanding of
        low-level programming with C and Assembly. My coursework has also enriched my knowledge in areas like discrete
        mathematics and Linux operating systems.</p>

      <p>Beyond the classroom, my internships and personal projects have provided me with real-world exposure to a
        myriad of technologies, frameworks, and tools. To name a few, I've worked with Ubuntu, AWS (Lambda,
        Step-Functions, EC2, S3), Azure, Visual Studio, VS Code, and delved into the intricate realms of neural networks
        and deep learning.</p>

      <p>What genuinely excites me about this field is the amazing potential to create almost anything. Whether it's
        developing software, learning a new technology, or crafting predictive models, I'm fueled by the joy of turning
        ideas into tangible solutions. As I look ahead, my aspiration is to serve as a software or machine learning
        engineer, where I not only contribute meaningfully to the company's goals but also continue my lifelong learning
        journey in technology.</p>

        <h3>Capital One, McLean, VA</h3>
        <p class="position"><strong>Software Engineering Intern (TIP)</strong><br>
          <span class="dates">June 2024 - August 2024</span>
        </p>

        <p>At my time with Capital One, I was placed in an intern pod with 2 other interns
          on a particularly high impact project. This project related to campaign recovery
          on the Portfolio Decisioning project of Capital One. This project is intended to
          create platforms for campaign management, which brings in millions in revenue and
          significant amounts of new customers for
          the company. My project was to develop a Admin Console UI using React and TypeScript
          that makes campaign recovery and actions easy for internal users. Before this project,
          those in charge of running campaigns and managing them would have to partake in extremely
          time-consuming and inefficient processes to enact these recovery processes. Our admin console
          allows users to avoid this and complete these processes easily and within minutes, saving
          the company potentially millions in revenue monthly.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Collaborated with a team of 3 interns to develop an admin console for managing credit card campaigns,
            leveraging
            React and TypeScript, resulting in a significant increase in productivity and usability for campaign
            managers, saving
            the company millions in revenue monthly.</li>
          <li>Utilized Cypress and Jest to rigorously test the application, ensuring high-quality, reliable software and
            contributing
            to the overall effectiveness of marketing strategies.</li>
          <li>Developed and implemented a series of API endpoints utilizing Python, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB to
            efficiently
            manage, log, and audit user actions within the admin console to ensure proper overhead and
            comprehensiveness.</li>
          <li>Utilized cucumber and cypress to conduct dynamic and flexible live-dependency tests. This task was a
            stretch goal for this internship,
            meaning we did not expect to accomplish it by the end of the 10 weeks. However, we were able to complete the
            admin console UI as well as
            the related API endpoints, allowing us to fully implement the cucumber feature tests. This part was
            particularly vague since our manager
            and respective team did not have any examples for me to learn from. I am particularly proud of this aspect
            of my time at Capital One since I
            was able to implement full coverage on these within a limited time frame and with limited direction.

          <span class="dates">June 2023 - August 2023</span>
        </p>

        <p>During my internship at Noblis, I played an essential role in enhancing the project data accessibility and
          user experience. One of my major contributions was the development of a comprehensive dashboard system that
          transformed how employees accessed and interacted with project insights:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Designed a dashboard that integrated visually appealing charts and data tables, enabling users to view
            project data, progress, and essential information effortlessly.</li>
          <li>Streamlined user tasks, eliminating the need for redirections to cluttered pages, providing a unified
            platform with multiple functionalities.</li>
          <li>Reduced the project backlog through effective Agile methodologies and daily stand-up meetings.</li>
          <li>Collaborated with cross-functional teams using ASP.NET MVC and Syncfusion, resulting in an intuitive user
            interface for the internal project budgeting system, enhancing user experience and reducing errors.</li>

          <span class="dates">June 2022 - August 2022</span>
        </p>

        <p>At OnSystem Logic, I was deeply involved in enhancing the security of our management console. While the goal
          was clear - integrating two-factor authentication - the task was intricate. Here's a closer look at my
          journey:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Deep-dived into the MVC structure of the management console, understanding the intricacies of models,
            views, and controllers.</li>
          <li>Explored and tested numerous libraries to find the perfect fit for two-factor authentication integration
            that would work in harmony with Google Authenticator.</li>
          <li>Successfully engineered a robust two-factor authentication process, reducing unauthorized access risk by a
            significant 75%.</li>
          <li>Enhanced user customization features on the console using the yii2 PHP framework, which simplified the
            monitoring and management of a wide range of machines.</li>
          <li>Developed Python scripts to optimize software behavioral learning data organization from over 5,000
            computers, achieving a 30% efficiency boost.</li>
